Start
======


GAPIT is a package that is run in the R software environment.
R can be freely downloaded from [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org).
We also recommend the integrated development environment RStudio which is also freely available at [RStudio at Posit](https://posit.co/).


GAPIT can currently be installed in several ways.

- From source on the internet
- From GitHub
- From an archive


## Installation from source functions

GAPIT can be loaded with a single funciton. 


```
R> source("http://zzlab.net/GAPIT/gapit_functions.txt")
```

Or from GitHub function.
```
R> source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiabowang/GAPIT/refs/heads/master/gapit_functions.txt", encoding = "UTF-8")
```

## Installation from GitHub

Installation can also be made from GitHub when the R package `devtools` is available.

```
R> install.packages("devtools")
R> devtools::install_github("jiabowang/GAPIT", force=TRUE)
R> library(GAPIT)

or
R> install.packages("remotes")
R> remotes::install_github("jiabowang/GAPIT")
R> library(GAPIT)


```

## Installation from an archive


GAPIT can be installed from an archive such as \*.tar.gz or \*.zip archive.
An archive can be downloaded from the "releases" page.
If you would like the latest version of GAPIT from the GitHub site you may want to clone it and then build it (this may require Rtools on Windows).

```
bash$ git clone git@github.com:jiabowang/GAPIT.git
bash$ R CMD build GAPIT
```

Once an archive has been obtained it can be installed from a shell, similar to as follows.


```
bash$ R CMD INSTALL GAPIT_3.5.0.9000.tar.gz
```

Or similarly from within R.

```
R> install.packages("GAPIT_3.5.0.9000.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

## In some case of the BiocManager can not be installed

Installation of same packages such as “multtest” and “biobase” can not be intalled from BiocManager directly. These packages can be downloaded in the Bioconductor website and be installed from local source files.

The website of Bioconductor is here:

```
https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/bioc/
```

Analysis
======

The taxa and order of individual among genotype file and phenotype files could be different. The GAPIT can automaticly filter and order the common taxa among among genotype file and phenotype files.

GWAS
-----
GWAS methods include: General Linear Model(GLM),Mixed Linear Model(MLM),compressed Mixed Linear Model(CMLM),SUPER, FarmCPU, MLMM, and BLINK. Users can use model="GLM" to select method. 

GS
-----
GS methods include: gBLUP, cBLUP, sBLUP, and GAGBLUP. Besides GAGBLUP, all GS methods could be seleted by using model="gBLUP".
